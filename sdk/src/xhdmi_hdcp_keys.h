* <b>Software Initialization & Configuration</b>

*
* <b>Interrupts </b>
*
* <b> Virtual Memory </b>
*
* This driver supports Virtual Memory. The RTOS is responsible for calculating
* the correct device base address in Virtual Memory space.
*
* <b> Threads </b>
*
* This driver is not thread safe. Any needs for threads or thread mutual
* exclusion must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* <b> Asserts </b>
*
* Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument
* values. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining at
* compile time, the NDEBUG identifier. By default, asserts are turned on and it
* is recommended that users leave asserts on during development.
